# Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification
In this notebook I explore and identify animal species in a real world dataset of wildlife images for [the Conser-vision competition on DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/page/409/).

The goal is to classify animal species that appear in camera trap images collected at the [Tai National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%C3%AF_National_Park) in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Camera traps are one of the best tools available to study and monitor wildlife populations, and the enormous amounts of data they provide can be used to track different species for conservation efforts - once they are processed.
